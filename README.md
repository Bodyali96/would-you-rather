# Would You Rather? Project

The final assessment project for Udacity's Redux Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to solidify the main principle of Redux store, actions, and reducers. The project is a polls platform, with the ability to:

    * See answered and unanswered polls
    * Answer polls
    * See insights about each answered poll
    * Create a poll
    * See Leaderboard for most active users
    * Change between signed-in users

## Requirements

Before running the project, you have to ensure that your device have:

-   Node.JS
-   NPM (Node Package Manager)
-   Yarn (Optional)

## Installation

To run the project, execute the following commands:

-   `npm install` or `yarn`
-   `npm start` or `yarn start`

## Important

Project uses a mock API to store data. So the data will be cleared when the page reloads.
